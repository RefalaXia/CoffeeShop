### Description
A local North Carolina coffee shop that is located in a suburban strip mall is struggling with (a) retaining customers, (b) increasing daily transactions, and (c) managing its rather large assortment. There arenâ€™t a lot of thriving businesses in the strip mall and the roads close are not that heavily frequented. There is a YMCA right around the corner - but it is unclear how to attract its members to come over for coffee or sweets. There are also several small professional offices in the adjacent area such as a dentist and an animal clinic.

### Question
Our question is: What specific changes can increase the coffee shop's profit/profitability?
